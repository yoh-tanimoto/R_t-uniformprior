# R_t-uniformprior

This Python code calculates the effective reproduction number R_t from the daily infection data.

In the present setting, the infection data are the number of symptomatic patients of COVID-19 in Italy based on the date of sympton onset, available at https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/sars-cov-2-dashboard .
The data are contained in sympdata.txt.

For the Poisson distrubtion of infectiveness, we use the Gamma distribution used by the Italian national health institute (Istituto Superiore di Sanit√†), as explained in https://www.iss.it/primo-piano/-/asset_publisher/o4oGR9qmvUz9/content/id/5477037 .
